# Step 1: Define the function
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    # Step 2: Check if the discount is 20% or more
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        # Step 3: Calculate the discounted price
        discount_amount = (discount_percent / 100) * price
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        # Step 4: Return the original price (no discount applied)
        return price

# Step 5: Prompt the user for the original price
original_price = float(input("Enter the original price: "))

# Step 6: Prompt the user for the discount percent
discount = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Step 7: Call the function with the inputs
final = calculate_discount(original_price, discount)

# Step 8: Print the result
print("Final price:", final)
