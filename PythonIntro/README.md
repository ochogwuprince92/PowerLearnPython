Dummy script# Pandas & Matplotlib Data Analysis Assignment

## Objective
The purpose of this assignment was to:  
1. Load and explore a dataset using the **pandas** library.  
2. Perform basic data analysis to understand patterns in the dataset.  
3. Visualize the data using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to extract insights.

---

## Dataset
- The analysis was performed on the **Iris dataset** (`iris.csv`).  
- The dataset contains the following columns:  
  - `sepal_length` (numeric)  
  - `sepal_width` (numeric)  
  - `petal_length` (numeric)  
  - `petal_width` (numeric)  
  - `species` (categorical)  

---

## Findings / Observations

### 1. Basic Statistics
- The dataset contains 150 rows with no missing values.  
- Sepal and petal dimensions vary across species.  
- `setosa` species has the smallest average petal length and width, while `virginica` has the largest.

### 2. Grouping Analysis
- Grouping by `species` shows clear differences in average sepal and petal dimensions.  
- This confirms that species can be differentiated based on these features.

### 3. Correlation
- Numerical features are positively correlated, especially `petal_length` and `petal_width`.  
- Strong correlations help in predicting species using machine learning models.

## Conclusion
- The Iris dataset exhibits clear separability among species based on flower dimensions.  
- Visualizations support exploratory data analysis and highlight patterns useful for classification.  
- Using **pandas** and **matplotlib**, we can efficiently clean, analyze, and visualize structured data to extract meaningful insights.
